# System Integration Assessment

This document answers four system-integration questions for the DispatchAI repository. Each answer includes a concise assessment, evidence from the codebase, and short recommendations.

## 1) Are the system boundaries clearly defined?

- Assessment: Partially. Component responsibilities are visible in code, but there is no single design document that explicitly states trust boundaries, public vs internal interfaces, or data classification.

- Evidence from repo:
  - `eleven_labs_lambda.py` shows the inbound webhook processing flow (signature check, geocoding, persistence to DynamoDB/S3), indicating a public HTTP → Lambda → storage boundary.
  - `wildfire-simulator-lambda.py` separates simulation responsibilities and shows where Bedrock is used vs template generation.
  - Setup artifacts like `create_aws_resources.py` and `lambda-geocoding-policy.json` indicate AWS resource responsibilities but don't document the threat/trust model.

- Recommendations:
  - Add a single `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` that lists public endpoints (API Gateway), trusted internals (Lambdas, DynamoDB, S3), and external services (ElevenLabs, Bedrock, Location Service).
  - Document data sensitivity (raw audio, transcripts, PII) and retention rules.

## 2) How well are the APIs and interfaces documented?

- Assessment: Minimal. The code contains inline examples and test events, but there is no formal API contract (OpenAPI, JSON Schema) or endpoint reference.

- Evidence from repo:
  - `eleven_labs_lambda.py` includes a test event in `if __name__ == '__main__'` and comments describing the expected `event` structure.
  - The simulator shows expected request parameters (`num_calls`, `scenario`, `table_name`) but lacks a documented schema or examples for clients.

- Recommendations:
  - Create an `API.md` or `openapi.yaml` describing endpoints, request/response schemas, headers (signature header), and sample payloads.
  - Add input validation in Lambdas (Pydantic models or JSON Schema) and include examples for common client calls.

## 3) What integration points have been identified?

- Assessment: Clear and explicit. The repo shows the primary internal and external services required for operation.

- Identified integration points (from code):
  - ElevenLabs — voice sessions and webhooks (ingest)
  - API Gateway — HTTP frontend for webhooks and simulator (implied)
  - AWS Lambda — compute for webhook and simulator handlers
  - DynamoDB — summarized call records
  - S3 — raw payload and archival storage
  - AWS Location Service (Place Index) — geocoding fallback
  - AWS Bedrock — used by simulator for richer summaries
  - Local scripts & infra helpers (`test_aws_connection.py`, `create_aws_resources.py`)

- Recommendations:
  - Produce an "Integration Matrix" that lists each service, auth method, data exchanged, rate limits, and failure modes.
  - Document mitigation strategies for cost or throttling (Bedrock usage, DynamoDB capacity, API Gateway throttling).

## 4) How modular is the solution?

- Assessment: Moderately modular. Handlers are separated and helper functions exist, but shared utilities, configuration, and schema contracts are not centralized.

- Evidence from repo:
  - Separate Lambdas (`eleven_labs_lambda.py`, `wildfire-simulator-lambda.py`) show functional separation.
  - Helpers like `geocode_location()` are implemented in-file rather than as shared modules.
  - Environment variables are read per-file; no central `config` module.

- Recommendations:
  - Create a `lib/` or `src/` package with small modules: `config.py`, `persistence.py`, `geocode.py`, and `schemas.py` (Pydantic or JSON Schema).
  - Move shared logic into these modules and update Lambdas to import them to reduce duplication and make testing easier.
  - Add unit tests for the shared modules and a CI job to run them.

---

If you want, I can now:
- Add `ARCHITECTURE.md` or expand the current `README.md` with trust boundaries and data classification.
- Create `API.md` or `openapi.yaml` for the webhook and simulator endpoints.
- Scaffold a `lib/` package and update one Lambda to use it (small, safe refactor).

Tell me which follow-up to run and I will update the todo list and start it.
